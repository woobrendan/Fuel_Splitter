# Fuel_Splitter

Fuel Splitter is a project build from a need to fairly distribute the costs of gas for a communal car. The app allows for tracking trips taken, and in the end, allocating the a percentage of the total miles taken and assigning the appropriate portion of the bill to the right person.
