# Fuel Splitter

Fuel Splitter is a project built from a need to fairly distribute the costs of gas for a communal car. The app allows for tracking trips taken, and in the end, allocating a percentage of the total miles taken and assigning the relative portion of the bill to the appropriate person.

## Technologies

This app uses Typescript as the primary language, and uses React for the front end and Express MVC model on the back end.
